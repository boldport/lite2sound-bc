*Lite2Sound BC* is an experimental circuit for exploring light through sound. It uses a photodiode to pick up lights changing at audio frequencies which feeds through an amplifier for monitoring on headphones or a small speaker. It is the result of a collaboration of Boldport's PCB design and [Rare Waves LLC](http://rarewaves.net) who designed the circuit. This project is produced and built using [PCBmodE](http://pcbmode.com).
